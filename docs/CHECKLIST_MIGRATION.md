# Checklist Command Migration

## Summary

Successfully migrated the bucket configuration validation functionality from a flag within the `analyze` command to a dedicated `checklist` command.

## Changes Made

### 1. Command Structure Changes
- **Before**: `mc-tool analyze --config-check alias/bucket`
- **After**: `mc-tool checklist alias/bucket`

### 2. Code Changes

#### Main Application (`main.go`)
- Removed `configCheck` global variable
- Removed `--config-check` flag from `analyze` command
- Added new `checklistCmd` with dedicated help and examples
- Added `runChecklist` function
- Simplified `runAnalyze` function by removing config check logic

#### Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md to reflect new command structure
- Updated examples to use `checklist` command instead of `--config-check` flag
- Added comprehensive usage examples for the new command

### 3. Benefits of Migration

#### Better Separation of Concerns
- **`analyze`**: Focus on object distribution, versions, and incomplete uploads
- **`checklist`**: Dedicated to bucket configuration validation

#### Improved User Experience
- Clearer command purpose and functionality
- More intuitive command structure
- Better help documentation

#### Enhanced Maintainability
- Single responsibility principle
- Easier to extend checklist functionality
- Cleaner code organization

### 4. Command Comparison

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Command | `analyze --config-check` | `checklist` |
| Purpose | Mixed: analysis + config check | Dedicated config validation |
| Help Text | Combined with analyze help | Dedicated help section |
| Args Validation | Path-based (with path component) | Bucket-focused (no path needed) |

### 5. Functionality Preserved

All bucket configuration validation features remain intact:
- ✅ Bucket existence verification
- ✅ Versioning configuration check
- ✅ Event notifications validation (Lambda, Topic, Queue)
- ✅ Object lifecycle policy analysis
- ✅ Server-side encryption verification
- ✅ Bucket policy security analysis

### 6. Testing

Added comprehensive tests to ensure:
- `checklist` command is available and works correctly
- `analyze` command no longer has `--config-check` flag
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Proper argument validation for new command

## Usage Examples

### Before Migration
```bash
# Configuration check was part of analyze
mc-tool analyze --config-check prod/my-bucket
```

### After Migration  
```bash
# Dedicated checklist command
mc-tool checklist prod/my-bucket
mc-tool checklist --verbose prod/my-bucket

# Clean analyze command focused on object analysis
mc-tool analyze prod/my-bucket
mc-tool analyze --verbose prod/my-bucket/path
```

## Conclusion

The migration successfully creates a cleaner, more intuitive command structure while preserving all existing functionality. Users now have dedicated commands for specific tasks, making the tool easier to understand and use.

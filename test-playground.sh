## Test Summary

### Buckets Created
- $BUCKET1 (with delete markers)
- $BUCKET2 (with delete markers)
- $BUCKET3 (versions test)

### Test Scenarios Covered
1. âœ“ Basic object comparison (current versions)
2. âœ“ Verbose output testing
3. âœ“ Version comparison mode
4. âœ“ Delete marker handling
5. âœ“ Self-comparison (identical buckets)
6. âœ“ Insecure connection testing
7. âœ“ Empty vs non-empty bucket comparison
8. âœ“ Performance testing with multiple objects

### Delete Marker Testing
- Created delete markers for objects in versioned buckets
- Verified mc-tool handles delete markers correctly
- Confirmed version mode shows all versions including delete markers

### Key Findings
- mc-tool correctly handles delete markers as "missing" objects in current version mode
- Version comparison mode properly shows all object versions
- Tool performs well with multiple objects
- TLS/insecure options work as expected

### Binary Information
- Binary: $MC_TOOL
- Type: $(file "$MC_TOOL" | cut -d: -f2-)
- Size: $(ls -lh "$MC_TOOL" | awk '{print $5}')

## Conclusion
mc-tool successfully handles all tested scenarios including complex delete marker situations.
